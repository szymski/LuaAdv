LuaAdv
======

LuaAdv is a programming language that outputs Lua code. I created it to add certain features to Lua language and make the code more readable.

Some of the features include: object oriented programming, static code analysis, lambda functions.

Check out *Documents* and *Examples* folders to see what the language looks like.
